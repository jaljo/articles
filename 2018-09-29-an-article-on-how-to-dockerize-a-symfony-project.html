  I had to take the time to relay a great article written by my teammates
  Antoine and Lena√Øc on
  <a href="https://knplabs.com/en/blog/how-to-dockerise-a-symfony-4-project">
    how to dockerize a Symfony 4 project
  </a>.
  It helped me a lot as I was quite new with docker when I joined the team. A
  good exercise for me to get used to docker core concepts was to dockerize this
  blog frontend and API. To be honnest, I was rather annoyed by the perspective
  to reset an entire production environment after I totally forgot to renew my
  domain name and host services (yes, yes). Anyway, the story ends well, as this
  raised perfect circumstances to learn and ease my life with docker.

  The entire setup is build on services orchestrated by docker-compose, you can
  check it by browsing the project repositories (see aside).
