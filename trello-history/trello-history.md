# How we extended the trello experience with power-ups

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a collaborative tool we use here at KNP to
split projects in little tasks and share their progression between developers
and clients.

If you're working for a few years in software development, you're aware that
even before architectural or implementation decisions, to define what does your
client really **needs** stays on top of every project challenges. Let's imagine
you and one of your collaborator (1) finally agreed on a feature definition (i.e
it's scope, what the feature will **do**, not how it will be achieved from a
more technical point of view).

In an agile project's workflow, there is chances some of these steps will
happend:
1. You create a new ticket in your favorite collaborative tool,
2. you write the feature definition down in this card,
3. you play poker with your teammates to give this card an estimation,
4. you work the hell out of your sweat and blood to get the job done,
5. you're proud of yourself and push the whole stuff in production,
6. because you're a good developper, the production is not down and you can
notify your client,
7. he says it's not what he needs because he surreptitiously changes the
feature's definition in the card, and nobody realized (see step 4),
8. you table flip the entire open space and think of extreme measures, like
expatriating yourself in the Loir-Et-Cher.

This little story brought to light the emergency for us to keep the history of
every changes made against a project's card. That way, we could have the chance
to point an accusing "AHA!" finger on him, in case the previous scenario occures
once more.

## From the idea to the POC

Speak about the first hackathon POC with a chromium extension and the several
drawbacks (directly manipulating the DOM)

## An implementation change

## Going further

A react impl ?
