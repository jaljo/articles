<p>
    <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> is a collaborative tool we use here
    at KNP to split projects in little tasks and share their progression between
    developers and clients.
</p>

<p>
    If you’ve been working in software development for a few years, you’re aware
    that even before architectural or implementation decisions, defining what
    your client really needs stays on top of every project’s challenges. Let’s
    imagine you and one of your collaborators finally agreed on a feature
    definition (i.e it’s scope, what the feature will do, not how it will be
    achieved from a more technical point of view).
</p>

<p>
    In an agile project’s workflow, chances are some of these steps will happen:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>you create a new ticket in your favorite collaborative tool,</li>
    <li>you write the feature definition down in this card,</li>
    <li>
        you play planning poker with your teammates to give this card an
        estimation,
    </li>
    <li>you work your ass off to get the job done,</li>
    <li>you’re proud of yourself and push the whole stuff in production,</li>
    <li>because you’re a good developper, the production is not down,</li>
    <li>
        the feature’s definition has changed in the card, and nobody realized it
        until now (see step 4),
    </li>
    <li>
        you table flip the entire open space and consider extreme measures, like
        relocating to Loir-et-Cher.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This little story brought to light the urgent need for us to log the history
    of every changes made against a project’s card. That way, we could have the
    opportunity to point an accusing “AHA!” finger at the unfortunate one who
    surreptitiously changed that card’s description.
</p>

<h2>From the idea to the POC</h2>

<p>
    We approached the problem with the idea of using a
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions">
        web extension
    </a>.
    They offer a convenient way to enhance the navigation experience and could
    be written using traditional browser-side web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
    So we created a POC during our last winter hackathon in January, to
    demonstrate that what we intended to do was possible:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>access a card history,</li>
    <li>render it on the back of that card with markdown support,</li>
    <li>randomly insert unicorns in the background.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    No black magic behind the scene. We simply used the
    <a href="https://developers.trello.com/docs/clientjs">
        Trello native client
    </a>
    to access their API with a good old XmlHttpRequest. In order to be called,
    the API requires explicit authentication:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>an auto generated API key,</li>
    <li>
        a token that is generated once the end user granted the API access, on
        behalf of the API key-identified user.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Although this first version worked quite well, it also had several drawbacks.
    Because Trello is an SPA and we decided to use a web extension, we had
    trouble dealing with asynchronicity. Indeed, the Trello API only lets us
    perform actions on domain-oriented objects (card, boards, members…); that is,
    we still had no way to directly interact with the Trello front application,
    nor could we listen for events such as card loading success to know when we
    should get and display its history.
</p>

<p>
    We considered getting around this problem by observing
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">
        DOM Mutations
    </a>,
    and detecting when a specific element entered the DOM, identified by its
    class or id. Oh listen, what’s that noise ? It sounds like the WTF alarms
    are ranging afar ! Relying on HTML attributes to identify elements, which
    are very likely to change over time, is a 100% chance for this project to
    end in the cemetery of repositories nobody dares to debug. We felt the time
    for a perspective change has come.
</p>

<h2>An implementation change</h2>

<p>
    Trello offers another possibility to build features upon their application,
    with what they so-called <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups">Power ups</a>.
    You can see them as external libraries which communicate with third-party
    services like Google, Facebook or the one you built with your little fingers.
    An important limitation though, these power ups are tied to specific
    locations opened by Trello, such as
    <span class="code">card-back, card-buttons</span>… These locations are
    designated by capabilities in their vocabulary.
</p>

        Please note that only administrators can create and expose power ups to
        their teams.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    At the bottom of that form, the iframe connector url targets where the
    application of the power up is hosted. As you can see, it must be served
    over HTTPS, which can be a bit tricky when working in a development
    environment.
</p>

<p>
    Here comes Serveo to the rescue ! In a nutshell,
    <a href="https://serveo.net/">Serveo</a> lets you expose any local server to
    the Internet, which was handy for our testing purposes. So all we had to do
    was to create a new project from the
    <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trello-power-up-skeleton">
        power up skeleton project
    </a>
    graciously offered by Trello and remix it to create our own service. This
    skeleton is hosted on <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>, which
    provides a friendly ecosystem to collaborate on code and offers instant
    hosting with automated deployment.
</p>

<p>
    Here is the file structure of the project:
</p>

<div class="git-gist" data-src="https://gist.github.com/jaljo/770fd3e36504c2496c834354558538fa.js"></div>

<p>
    Nothing fancy here. First, we perform an authorization check, then we render
    the history of the card if the user is authenticated, or we display a button
    to ask authorization to access the API if they’re not:
</p>

<div class="git-gist" data-src="https://gist.github.com/jaljo/609cb4ee547cdb049785ae2329451476.js"></div>

<p>
    Here are some explanations on this piece of code: the
    <span class="code">initialize</span> method takes an object as its first
    parameter, which associates each capability with the callback it should
    execute (in this case, as soon as the back of one card is revealed).
</p>

<p>
    Keep in mind that power up capabilities are rendered in iframes. Yes. Please
    don’t leave. The <span class="code">renderHistory</span> and
    <span class="code">askAuthorization</span> at the end of the promise flow
    are simple functions that both return descriptive objects of how these
    iframes should be displayed. The important thing to understand is here: Each
    iframe targets a specific HTML page which runs its own JS script. That is,
    how can we possibly share data between those scripts ?
</p>

<p>
    See that <span class="code">t</span> argument ? It’s the power up toolbox,
    exposing helpful methods to interact with the context of the Trello board.
    For example, the <span class="code">t.set()</span> method is to be used to
    store scalar values in the context (translations, for example, are a perfect
    use case for it). Once stored, a <span class="code">t.get()</span> method
    can be called from any other script to get our translations back. Piece of
    cake !
</p>

<p>
    This can be misleading, though. Tricked by our daily habits, we spent some
    time trying to over decouple things (i.e get the history data from the API
    in the main power up script above, store it in the context and only use
    other scripts for templating). The Trello buffer has a limit size of 4096
    characters, so no need to say we didn’t have any chance to successfully
    store our stringified history there ! We wandered towards locale storage and
    string compression to bypass that limitation but finally figured out this is
    not how it was supposed to be done.
</p>

<p>
    One script per iframe / page to be shown, simple as that. Let’s have a quick
    look on the history script:
</p>

<div class="git-gist" data-src="https://gist.github.com/jaljo/c4a18178a7510d2885e5ff6c39ee70b5.js"></div>

<p>
    The <span class="code">t.render()</span> method ensures the history section
    is refreshed each time the user modifies the description of a card (so the
    previous description will be added to the history).
</p>

<p>
    Here you can see how we get the translations from the context. We’re also
    using <a href="https://ramdajs.com/docs/">ramda</a> to get full benefit of
    promise composition and fetch the card history from Trello. The
    <span class="code">
        renderCard
    </span>
    function does nothing more than transforming a <span class="code">card</span>
    object returned from the API in a renderable HTML string, and that’s all !
</p>

<h2>Going further</h2>

<p>
    Of course, accessing a card’s history could have been achieved in many other
    ways: by connecting Trello to Slack for example. That said, we liked the
    idea of not depending of another service and having an “out of the box”
    solution that would work anywhere.
</p>

<p>
    In the end, it was quite a pleasant journey to discover the Trello API and
    how to build power ups with it. Although their documentation is pretty
    sized, information is sometimes scattered, tedious to find and lacks of
    complete examples. Power ups still are a new thing in the Trello landscape
    (< 100 power ups were released as of late 2018), and we learned it the hard
    way when we faced problems with the authentication process.
</p>

<p>
    Speaking of which, please remember that once the auth token is obtained,
    Trello will save it server-side. So if you’re facing authentication problems
    or weird behavior, cleaning cookies or the cache browser side won’t be of
    any help. We almost went nuts because of this, until we found out there was
    a special button made to get rid of that token:
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaljo/articles/master/trello-history/images/reset-token.png" alt="reset-token" />
    <figcaption>Use that button to clear the token cache server side.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    The final version of the Power-up was done during our last summer hackathon,
    and we are pretty proud of it. We didn’t had the time to go for a better,
    more decoupled architecture but it may be worth giving a try on an FRP
    implementation with React and Redux. We’re also considering to releasing
    this power up to the Trello marketplace.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to use it for your own Trello boards, you can either host the
    <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/knplabs/trello-history-powerup">
        Docker image of the project by yourself
    </a>
    or directly use
    <a href="https://trello-history-powerup.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/index.html">
        our hosted service
    </a>
    .
